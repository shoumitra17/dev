        <h1>Road Map For Full Stack </h1>
    </header>
    <p>Full Stack Development refers to the practice of working on both the frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side) of a web application. A full stack developer is skilled in technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend, and uses languages like Node.js, Python, or PHP along with databases such as MySQL or MongoDB for the backend. Being a full stack developer means having the ability to build and manage an entire web application from start to finish.
</p>
<p>So here is a complete road map which will help you in becoming a full stack web developer.</p>

    <div class="div1">
        <h2><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">Html</a></h2>
        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It uses tags to define elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. HTML forms the backbone of every website and works together with CSS and JavaScript to build modern web pages.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="div1">
        <h2><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/">CSS</a></h2>
        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and design web pages. It controls how HTML elements look — including colors, fonts, layout, and spacing. With CSS, you can make websites visually appealing, responsive, and consistent across devices.
        </p>
        </div>
    <div class="div1">
        <h2><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/">JavaScript</a></h2>
        <p>JavaScript is a powerful programming language used to make web pages interactive. It allows developers to create dynamic features like image sliders, form validation, dropdown menus, and more. JavaScript runs in the browser and works alongside HTML and CSS to enhance the user experience.
        </p>
        </div>
    <div class="div1">
        <h2><a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a></h2>
        <p>jQuery is a lightweight JavaScript library that simplifies tasks like DOM manipulation, event handling, animation, and AJAX requests. With its concise syntax—“write less, do more”—jQuery lets developers achieve complex interactions in just a few lines of code while maintaining broad cross‑browser compatibility.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="div1">
        <h2><a href="https://nodejs.org/en">Node.js</a></h2>
        <p>Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side. It's built on Chrome's V8 engine and is known for its speed, scalability, and event-driven architecture. With Node.js, developers can build fast, real-time web applications like chat apps, APIs, and more using JavaScript on both the frontend and backend.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="div1">
        <h2><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-database/">Database</a></h2>
        <p>Databases are systems used to store, manage, and organize data so it can be easily accessed and updated. In web development, databases like MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL are commonly used to store user information, content, and application data.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="div1">
        <h2><a href="https://react.dev/">React.js</a></h2>
        <p>React.js is a popular JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building fast and interactive user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update the page when data changes.</p>
